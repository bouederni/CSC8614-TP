    "# CSC 8614 - Language Models\n",
    "## CI3 - Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with LoRA\n",
    "\n",
    "This TP builds upon the GPT architecture we have previously explored. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from scratch and inject it into our pre-existing GPTModel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "- Implement the mathematical formulation of LoRA.\n",
    "- Create a wrapper to convert standard Linear layers into LoRA-compatible layers.\n",
    "- Inject these layers into a pre-trained GPT model.\n",
    "- Verify that only a fraction of parameters are trainable.\n",
    "- Fine-tune the model with LoRA\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of this code comes from the book _Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)_, by Sebastian Raschka, and its [official github repository](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch).\n",
    "\n",
    "This TP will be done in this notebook, and requires some additional files (available from the course website). \n",
    "You will have to fill the missing portions of code, and perform some additional experiments by testing different parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working on this TP:\n",
    "- The easiest way is probably to work directly on the notebook, using jupyter notebook or visual studio code. An alternative is also to use Google colab.\n",
    "- You should be able to run everything on your machine, but you can connect to the GPUs if needed.\n",
    "- **NOTE**: run the cells in the correct order, otherwise you might get errors due to inconsintencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some files are required, and are available on the course website and/or github repo:\n",
    "- `requirements.txt`\n",
    "- `gpt_utils.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the report\n",
    "You will have to return this notebook (completed), as well as a mini-report (`TP3/rapport.md`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook and report shall be submitted via a GitHub repository, similarly to what you did for the previous sessions (remember to use a different folder: `TP3`).\n",
    "For the notebook, it is sufficient to complete the code and submit the final version.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the mini-report, you have to answer the questions asked in this notebook, and discuss some of your findings as requested.\n",
    "Same as in the previous sessions:\n",
    "- You must include: short answers, observed results (copies of outputs), requested screenshots, and a brief interpretation.\n",
    "- Do not paste entire pages: be concise and select the relevant elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reproducibility: \n",
    "- fix a random seed and write it in the report\n",
    "- indicate in the report the specific python version OS, and the library versions."
